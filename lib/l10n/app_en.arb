  "facaPressao":"• Apply selection pressure for fertility by discarding heifers and cows that do not conceive or calve at the end of the calving season;\n\n• Apply reproductive and ecto and endo parasitic vaccines before the mating season; avoid managing them as much as possible for up to one month after conception to reduce pregnancy losses;\n\n• Provide quality mineral salt throughout the year for the entire herd;\n\n• For cows with calf at the foot to have greater chances of repeat calving, they must calve with a body condition above 3 (1-5).\n",
  "obterFemeasPrec":"\n• To obtain precocious females, start using breeders and sires genetically evaluated for precocity, pay attention to the birth weight of the sires;\n\n• Plan the feeding of the mother, a good protein and energy nutrition in the middle third of pregnancy will reflect on the reproductive performance of her progeny;\n\n• Higher weights at weaning of the heifers, values ​​above 170Kg, will imply the need for smaller weight gains after weaning until mating;\n\n• The heifer must reach at least 55% of the adult weight of the cows in the herd to start mating;\n\n• Females, with a reproductive tract score above four (4) and body condition above three, are more likely to conceive in their first mating season;\n\n• Start mating heifers at least a month before the other categories, females giving birth early are more likely to repeat offspring.\n",
  "estacaoAcasalamento":"\nBREEDING SEASON\n",
  "estabelecaEstacao":"\n• Establish the mating season and, consequently, calving according to the availability of food and the welfare of the animals;\n\n• Start the mating season when 4% of females show signs of heat per day;\n\n• In a 90-day mating season, in the first month, 60% of singles come into heat, 30% of heifers and cows with calf, less than 10%. These tend to concentrate their heat at the end of the season. This information is important for distributing the breeders throughout the season.\n",
  "utilizeRepMerito":"\n• Use sires with genetic merit, either by artificial insemination or for transfer, in the latter case, they must pass the andrological exam and the libido test ;\n\n• Use sires of the same age and, preferably, the same management group in a ratio of 1:25, in the first 45 days of the mating season, this ratio may increase to 1:50 by the end; If the paddocks are of large size, use 6% of breeders;\n\n• Review the performance of breeders in the field: juveniles, daily, adults, two to three times a week; You can also identify the dominant individuals in the herd; \n\n• Assess body condition, especially young and old bull.\n\n• Always keep a reserve of 10 to 15% of suitable bulls on the farm, with a view to possible replacements;\n\n• Bulls from other farms need an adaptation period of at least 45 days.\n",
  "reservePotreiroMaternidade":"\n• Reserve a maternity paddock that allows greater control of the animals, with a good supply of forage, water and shade;\n\n• Try to concentrate calving on the first 42 days of the season;\n\n• Check if the dam was interested and caring for the newborn calf mainly among first-calf heifers;\n\n• Make sure the calf has suckled colostrum;\n\n• Dip the calf's navel with antiseptic solutions;\n\n• Record all occurrences related to calving such as: type of calving (normal or assisted), occurrence of  retained placenta, stillbirths, deformities, among others) and, if possible, weigh the calf and its dam within 24 hours of birth;\n\n• Start dosing with endoparasitic from 3 months of age and repeat every 2 months, remember that these animals need strategic deverminations up to 2 years of age at least.\n",
